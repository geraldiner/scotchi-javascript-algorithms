# ScotchIO JavaScript Algorithms

Work for Scotch.io's Ultimate Guide to JavaScript Algorithms: https://scotch.io/courses/the-ultimate-guide-to-javascript-algorithms

## How It's Made

**Tech used:** JavaScript

All of these challenges were built as functions in Vanilla JavaScript.

## Optimizations

I liked that the solutions walked through optimized solutions. I'm still learning this part, so it's nice to read about what factors go into determining its efficiency. The more exposed I am to it, the more I learn.

## Lessons Learned

Surprisingly, I have seen a number of these challenges before. Also, I felt brave so I decided to try it them before looking at the solutions. It wasn't until I got to some of the later array challenges that I felt a little doubtful. But it was still great practice for problem-solving skills, especially if I'm met with an unknown problem during an interview.
